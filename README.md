# Ember Electron SQL

This repository is a small [Ember Electron](https://ember-electron.js.org/) SQLite application. Demonstrating how to use SQLite with an Ember Electron application.

This repository borrows code from [Felix Rieseberg](https://felixrieseberg.com/) repository [Waffle](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/waffle)

# The Challenge

Ember is a framework for ambitious web developers. It is an opinionated web framework incorporating common idioms and best practices. Being a web framework it built around JSON API calls, not local database access. So I couldn't find much information on the internet about plugging in a database.

Ember Observer doesn't have any local database [adapters](https://emberobserver.com/categories/ember-data-adapters). While researching I came across a YouTube video in which Felix discussed Ember Electron and an app he developed called Waffle that uses SQLite.

To try and understand what was going on I decided to write a test application.
